    <p class="p-space"> With Spring approaching, this look is casual yet edgy at the same time and suitable for today's temperature. With a high of 71 degrees, a short sleeve grey shirt, and black denim jeans with a cuff is a neutral color look.

    <br>
    <br>To further complete the look, one can add some accessories such as a necklace, bracelets, rings, fedora and shades. Oh, and a little 5 oclock shadow doesn't hurt either.</p>
